			      <p>we've tried playing this many times before and idk why but it never *clicked*. well now we're so obsessed we've not only been dissecting it in rpgmaker but we've goaded our companion into finally completing it with us. we're using <a href = "https://ynoproject.net/">ynoproject</a> which is a site that hosts yume nikki and some of its fangames online with multiplayer compatibility. after the two of us are through, you may find us in 2kki (our username is candle777). this game and its related media may get a fanpage.</p>

			      <p>an egregious nukige. really goofy characters get into some really goofy antics. this game is actually pretty funny at times. some of the bdsm stuff in this is equal parts silly and hot. there's a girl with swirly glasses -w-. there's also a tie-in hentai but it's very bad.</p>
