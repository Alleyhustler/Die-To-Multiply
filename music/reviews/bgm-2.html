            <p>i’m a huge YMO fan (and a sucker for electronic trios apparently), yet i have never heard this one (strange i know). their sound has changed quite a bit from their previous two albums in 1979. utilizing some enticing minor chord progressions and irresistible synth sounds (including a very early use of 808s; they were the first to use them), you can get a good feel of the individual styles of all three members throughout the album. it starts off fairly tame (a synthpop song with vocals from Takahashi) but quickly after the first song, listeners ears are met with a more experimental sound (Sakamoto’s “Happy End”). there’s also a Fucking Amazing synth rework of “1000 Knives”. my favorite track off this album would have to be “Cue” because i’m fond of Takahashi’s vocals and the song’s somber disposition. likely sealing it’s fate as my favorite album of theirs, this is a lot more than background music. if you’re unfamiliar with YMO, this is probably the best starting point you could ask for.</p>
